title: Rails 3.1 controversy
---

Yesterday Twitter exploded with rants regarding the Rails' adoption of
[SaaS](http://sass-lang.com/) and [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/). I
have my opinion about [SaaS](http://sass-lang.com/) and [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/). Some people love them some people
don't. Rails was once a monolithic creature which forced developers to use the
components chosen by the community or [DHH](http://twitter.com/#!/dhh) himself. Why the HELL should be
return to that state ? 

In my opinion the merging of Merb and Rails was the best
thing that could happen to Rails. We (developers) finally got to choose the
components we want to work with. I perceive the 3.1 revelations as a step back.
Can't developers decide on their own ? Do we have to learn new fancy layers of
abstraction each time a new 'cool' or 'awesome' gem emerges on the scene ?

Normally today's apps depend on tens of Ruby gems. I would prefer to add [SaaS](http://sass-lang.com/)
and [CoffeeScript](http://coffeescript.org/) as a dependency if I needed them other than to be forced to
remove them every time a start a new app (Prototype all over again). Besides be
a man and learn the damn JavaScript already (and stop whining about the ugly semicolons) instead of applying Ruby-like syntax to everything.
