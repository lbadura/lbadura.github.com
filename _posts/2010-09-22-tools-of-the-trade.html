title: Tools of the trade
---

<p>
Inspired by <a href="http://rubyflow.com/items/2865">Peter Cooper</a> I too decided to share my tools of the trade. I learned about some new tools while flickering through their tools to I'm also listing mine in case anybody will find this information useful.
</p>
<br/><h3>Hardware</h3><br/>
<ul>
    <li>Intel Core i5 760 PC with 4 GB of RAM</li>
    <li>14" ThinkPad T60 with 2,5 GB of RAM</li>
    <li>Eizo FlexScan S1931</li>
    <li>a small whiteboard for quick sketches of diagrams</li>
</ul>

<p>When hardware is concerned I used to do all my work on the Thinkpad T60. It's a really reliable machine. Never had any problems with it. I've bought it four years ago and the only thing I had to replace was the fan. If was working fine, however started being quite noisy (but after four years of heavy usage it's no wonder). For a while after assembling my PC I considered swapping the T60 for a netbook however a netbook wouldn't run a Glassfish instance (and I do much of my daily work with the Jruby + Glassfih duo). </p>
<p>While working in my home office I use the Intel Core i5 based PC. I've assembled it myself from a set of silent components, so that it is pretty quiet which is an important factor. I always work with an external monitor and my few years old S1931 is perfect for working both with text and graphics.</p>

<br/><h3>Software</h3><br/>
<ul>
    <li>Arch Linux on both computers</li>
    <li>Gnome Terminal</li>
    <li>git, svn in that order</li>
    <li>rvm (rubies: MRI 1.8.7 to 1.9.2, JRuby 1.3.1, 1.5.1)
    <li>Vim & NetBeans</li>
    <li>Firefox + Firebug, the rest of the browsers for compatibility checking only</li>
    <li>Skype, Psi</li>
</ul>

<p>I've been a Gentoo user for a long time, however once I started my first job here in Krak√≥w I did't have the time to configure it. I had to setup something usable fast, so I've installed Ubuntu. Ubuntu however started turning into a Linux's own version of Windows with it's daily updates nagging me all the time, and constatly heavier components. That's why I started looking for an alternative and installed Arch Linux. So far I'm happy with it, and it seems like a good compromise between Gentoo and Ubuntu. I don't have to compile everything but have an excellent package manager at my disposal in order to keep my system up to date and lightweight.</p>
<p>While working on RoR applications (coding, running servers, looking through logfiles, running rake tasks and so on) I spend most of my time in front of a terminal emulator. Gnome Terminal does the job nicely. Tried others (e.g. Sakura) but after a while I always come back to Gnome Terminal.</p>
<p>The version control system sometimes depends on customers, however whenever I can choose I choose git. I liked it from the start (before the GitHub era) despite the tough learning curve. It's fast and comfortable (once you get to know it). Most of the Ruby open source projects being hosted on GitHub is also a plus (easy way to fork/submit a patch etc.).</p>
<p>The editor choice is a subject for a whole separate post. I've worked long enough with both vim and NetBeans to know their strengths and weaknesses. I like vim because it's blazing fast, code is rendered nicely, and it's present on most of the systems I deal with. Despite clever navigational plugins it's sometimes hard to navigate in bigger projects or some other people's code. That's where NetBeans kicks in. I use both.</p>
<p>Firefox is my browser of choice. It's slower than Chromium, but I would miss some of my Firefox plugins if I switched for Chromium (It's all text for e.g.). Firebug is also invaluable while working on web applications. I know there are similar projects for other browsers (Opera, Chromium) however I find firebug the most comfortable to work with.</p>
<p>For communication (besides e-mail) I tend to use Skype and Psi. Skype because it's popular, enables you to talk to and see your caller and also share screens which can be really handy. I use Psi to chat with friends and communicate with some external apps.</p>

<br/><h3>Remote apps</h3><br/>
<ul>
    <li><a href="http://github.com/lbadura">GitHub</a> - for hosting my personal projects</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.mindmeister.com">MindMeister</a> - for quick mind mapping</li>
    <li><a href="http://www.dropbox.com/referrals/NTkwOTYyMDE5">Dropbox</a> - great way to sync files from my HTC phone, or to sync dotfiles with</li>
    <li><a href="http://apidock.com/">Apidock</a> - to quickly look up stuff from Ruby / Rails documentation</li>
</ul>

And what are your tools of the trade ?
