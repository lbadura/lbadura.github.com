<p>I should have written this a long time ago, however maybe it's for the best, since this way I can write about the talks I remember the most.</p>

<p>This year's <a href="http://www.euruko2010.org">EuRuKo</a> conference came to an end. First of all I'd like say a big
"Thank you" to the organizers. Apart from the weird registration process they
did their job well. The conference room where the talks took place was a bit small (for the number of people attending) however nobody complained since it was a backup venue for the one that has been flooded.</p>

I really enjoyed this year's talks. I think they were even better that those during the last year's EuRuKo in Barcelona.

<strong>Day #1</strong>
<p>
Matz had problems flying in to Cracow, so his talk was swapped with <a href="http://github.com/chastell/showoff-euruko-2010">"Profiling Ruby 1.9"</a> by <a href="http://github.com/Chastell">Piotr Szotkowski</a>. Piotr presented some really interesting workflow of optimizing ruby code. One lesson that I
learned: don't necessary trust the standard library. Sometimes you can end up with a significantly faster piece of code for your given use case than a standard library method. The ideas and examples of the talk were clear so it was a pleasure to listen to.
</p>
<p>
The second talk I also liked was <a href="http://github.com/rocky">Rocky Bernstein's</a> <strong>"Rbdbgr, a debugger for Ruby 1.9"</strong>. I think Rocky's project is really promising. I got a chance to talk with Rocky after his talk and he confirmed that in the long term a version for JRuby is possible so I'm keeping my fingers crossed.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://github.com/josevalim">Jos√© Valim</a> did a very good job on his talk <strong>"DSL or NoDSL? - The power is in the middle"</strong>. The examples were very good, interesting questions from the crowd, and no answer for the topic question :-).
</p><p>
I have to mention <a href="http://github.com/floere">Florian Hanke's</a> <strong>"Building a search engine with Ruby"</strong> - he had the funniest slides (I especially liked the one with Matz in a car on ruby wheels) :-).
</p>
<strong>Day #2</strong>
<p>
The second day of the conference brought some nice talks as well. I liked <a href="http://github.com/svenfuchs">Sven Fuchs'</a> <strong>"Anatomy of Ruby i18n"</strong> (also everybody got to know how to pronounce his name via one of the slides :-)). 
</p><p>
The best public speaker was <a href="http://schacon.github.com/">Scott Chacon</a> with <strong>"Gittin down to the plumbing"</strong>. You may not like git or the overall topic, but I think Scott was really well prepared. He spoke dynamically and had excellent examples.
</p><p>
<a href="http://sickill.net/">Marcin Kulik</a> presented a nice topic of <strong>"Building web frameworks with Rack"</strong> however it was difficult to hear him at the back of the room. Good thing the recordings have been published so it's easy to watch it again.
</p><p>
Neil Straford from <a href="https://www.tropo.com/home.jsp">Tropo.com</a> presented some amazing stuff regarding voice enabling your application. Definitely something to play with, especially there's a free sandbox for developers set up.
</p><p>
The lighting talks were nice as usual. I really enjoyed <a href="http://www.fernandoguillen.info/">Fernando Gullien's</a> lighting talk about his zombie game (masterpiece !).

To sum up the conference was a blast. I'm really looking forward to the next year's event in Berlin !
