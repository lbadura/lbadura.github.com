A common belief is that temporary solutions last the longest. A simple <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bash/">bash</a> script that used to handle my image resizing needs was an excellent example of such a solution. It was hard to find a good enough reason to write anything more sophisticated than a five liner in bash to resize a directory of images downloaded from my camera. Not until I started to use <a href="http://www.neatimage.com/">NeatImage</a> for removing noise from my photos. It would be nice to be able to automatically rename and move files processed by <a href="http://www.neatimage.com/">NeatImage</a>, and then resize them to a given percentage size, to finally upload them to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/ukasbadu/">my Flickr account</a>. In a couple of hours I managed to write a simple script to do the resizing for me. It'd go faster if I'd known the <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/optparse/rdoc/classes/OptionParser.html">OptionParser</a> or the <a href="http://seattlerb.rubyforge.org/ImageScience.html">ImageScience</a> classes beforehand :-). Nothing to regret though, works way faster than the bash &amp; <a href="http://www.imagemagick.org/index.php">ImageMagick</a> duo. ImageScience doesn't have ImageMagick's bells and whistles, however is perfect for image resizing in Ruby as it utilizes the fast <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/freeimage">FreeImage</a> library written in C. What's left to do is to add some error handling, and implement additional options (e.g. sending to flickr).
