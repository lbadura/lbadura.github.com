For quite some time, I've been really frustrated with the look and feel of my source editor in <a href="http://www.netbeans.org">NetBeans</a>. I really liked the color schemas I have been using in my vim work flow. In fact it was probably the only thing (perhaps besides speed) that kept me using vim instead of <a href="http://www.netbeans.org">NetBeans</a>. I didn't settle with themes such as <a href="http://blog.huikau.com/2008/01/25/aloha-color-theme-for-netbeans-6/">Aloha</a> or <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/tor/entry/ruby_screenshot_of_the_week19">Dark Pastels</a>, and tried to "port" Nick Moffitt's <a href="http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2175">Railscasts vim theme</a> into <a href="http://www.netbeans.org">NetBeans</a>. You can see the final outcome on the screenshot above. I would gladly package it as a NBM file, however I don't know how one could build a NBM file (yet :-)). The bottom line is, working with <a href="http://www.netbeans.org">NetBeans</a> is a bit more enjoyable now.
