title: JRuby bliss
---

I've been fiddling with <a href="http://www.jruby.org">JRuby</a> for about a month now and I have to say it's
great. For those of you who don't know what it is - it's an implementation of
the Ruby language written in Java. Most people are familiar only with the
Matz's implementation in C (MRI = Matz's Ruby Interpreter also known as
CRuby). Having Ruby available on top of the JVM is a big leverage. I was
surprised how easy it was to incorporate Java code into Ruby code and vice
versa.

The most work I do is web development with Rails. <a href="http://www.jruby.org">JRuby</a> supports Rails since
version 0.9. Right now it runs all Rails test cases, is <del datetime="2009-10-10T14:37:34+00:00">compatible</del> <a href="http://kenai.com/projects/jruby/pages/Ruby1_9Support">partialy compatible</a> with Ruby
1.9 and improved performance. The existing Rails applications
I've worked on run significantly faster on <a href="http://www.jruby.org">JRuby</a> than on CRuby (JVM rocks).
You also get to compile your Ruby classes to Java classes or use your
favourite Java libraries in you Ruby apps.

The only downside at the moment is the Gem compatibility issues (not all Ruby
code runs on JRuby, however can be adjusted in most cases). <a href="http://www.jruby.org">JRuby</a> doesn't
support the use of native extensions which in consequence forces you to swap
some gems for others or to find pure Ruby (which means <a href="http://www.jruby.org">JRuby</a> compatible)
implementations.

The bottom line is, <a href="http://www.jruby.org">JRuby</a> provides you with exciting new possibilities. I'm
looking forward to see the next releases by the <a href="http://www.jruby.org">JRuby</a> team.
